# eRepublik Stuff++

## General Information
This is a partly deobfuscated version of eRepublik Stuff++, a browser extension for eRepublik. This script was created by the eRepublik player Zordacz. He left the game and added several backdoors into his script.

We are trying to deobfuscate the code (make it more readable) and also remove all known backdoors and exploits from this script.

Use at your own risk!

## Currently removed backdoors, exploits and other features

* Day 4,800 deactivation
* Auto Subscribe
* Code Injection / Sideload via u.json (RickRoll)
* Moved the update check and distribution to a secure site (eRepublik.tools)

## How to contribute

We are open to pull requests. Right now we will only accept pull requests which deobfuscate the code. We won't accept pull requests which add new features as long as huge parts of the script aren't maintainable.
